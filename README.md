A quick and open electronic laboratory notebook, aimed at replacing physical laboratory notebooks for computational scientists.

THIS PROGRAM IS UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT AND IS NOWHERE NEAR READY FOR PRODUCTION USE. 

Presently, this program simply provides a command line interface for entering typical lab notebook-like comments
into a time-stamped logbook file. 

It will soon also provide:
--A way to view and search the logbook
--A file-tracking system (likely using Git to do some heavy lifting)
--A syncing service
--A GUI
